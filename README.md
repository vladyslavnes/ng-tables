## Using userscripts
Userscripts here are something like formulas in Excell - you can use the value of any column on this row.
For example, you have to find the discriminant of quadratic equation. Here's what you'll need to do:
1. Create base row
2. Add columns you need (for example - a,b and c)
3. Create as much rows of different values as you need
4. Add another column to store your calculation results (e.g: D)
5. Press the "Use script" button
6. Enter the name of the column you entered in step 4
7. Write the formula
8. Enjoy the result!
